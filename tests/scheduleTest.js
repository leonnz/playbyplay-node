/**
 *    Game Time Schedule
 *
 *    1. At 5.00pm UTC every day this schedule runs on a Heroku worker process.
 *    2. Gets the days first game start time and pass it to the gametime service.
 *    2. The gametime service runs every 24 seconds and checks for active games and populates the play by play data.
 *
 *    Schedule time equivalents
 *      - 5pm UTC
 *      - 1pm EDT (USA)
 *      - 3am AEDT (Melbourne, following day)
 *
 *    The schedule starts at 1pm EDT presuming the NBA API is refreshed at 12pm EDT.
 *    The schedule relies on the reloadData.js script to have run at 4.40pm UTC.

/**
 *  On the front end it gets messy to handle pbp data with a queue manager and game box data separately.
 *  Consider using a queue manager in this process for both pbp and gamebox data.
 *
 *  Instead of running the gameTimeService every 24 seconds run it once, each getGamePbp service will then run once,
 *  inside each getGamePbp service will a schedule, with a queue manager. The queue manager will as follows:
 *
 *  Initiate the 2 queue's, a main pbp queue and a dummy pbp queue behind the scenes which are identical at first.
 *  Only the dummy pbp queue is saved to Firestore.
 *
 *  At the schdeuled interval get the latest data from NBA API and save as the main pbp queue.
 *  If the main pbp queue array is greater than the dummy pbp queue array then push the last event from the main pbp queue onto
 *  the dummy pbp queue, repeat until the queues are the same length.
 *
 *  The main nba doc data may have to be merged with the game pbp docs.
